[Verse 1]
Girl, I got one question, are you still awake?
Awake enough for me to see you (see you)
Please just listen, yes, I know it's late
But better late than never

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's five in the morning, morning
Not sure who I'm calling, calling
You haven't heard from me in some time
Girl, I hope you want it, want it
When you hear me talking, talking
You know I've been out and is it ok I stop by?

[Chorus]
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might be lonely, lonely

[Verse 2]
Emma I did, and Sophie I kissed, baby
Sarah I had in my hand, but I'm calling you
But not before it's past two o'clock
'Cause I'm balling with my boys, my boys, my boys

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's five in the morning, morning
Not sure who I'm calling, calling
You haven't heard from me in some time
Girl, I hope you want it, want it
When you hear me talking, talking
You know I've been out and is it ok I stop by?

[Chorus]
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might lonely, lonely

[Bridge]
I know you're glad I called, now you can have it all
When we're together you'll know how it should be
When you're drunk
Maybe we should go and spend some time alone
Baby, you're so beautiful
When I'm drunk, when I'm drunk, yeah

[Chorus]
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning I'm calling you
You might lonely, lonely
